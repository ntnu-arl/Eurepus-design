# Eurepus CAD and Control Code

This repository contains the CAD files for Eurepus and the test setups, as well as the deployed code on Eurepus. Specifically, the folder contains:

- Eurepus: CAD files of Eurepus.
- Eurepus_Control: The deployed controller code on Eurepus. The node running in the free fall tests is `src/eurepus_control/scripts/eurepus_control_mocap_80Hz.py`.
- Free Fall Mounts: CAD files for the free fall mount.
- Rotating_Pole: CAD files of the rotating pole setup.

# WIP
This repository is a work in progress and will hopefully be restructured before open-sourcing the design during the fall.
